                Schools have the option for parents to use a
                numeric four digit check-in code during drop off and pick up.  Your check-in
                code will be emailed to you after you create your account. You can change your
                check-in code anytime within your profile settings.

                        Login and make sure your contact info and your child’s

                        If you have additional kids at this school or another
                        school using brightwheel, you can enter additional invite codes.

                    <li>
                        Add additional guardians to brightwheel within your child’s profile.  For example,
                        a nanny or friend who has your approval to pick up your child from school, or a
                        grandparent that would like to see daily photos on brightwheel.
